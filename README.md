# Fast-RCNN-Lite

I write my own version of Faster RCNN (dont expect it to be professional)

I recommend open the notebook instead of .py files (because I only use google colab and never managed to install GPU for my computer)

### There are 3 main parts of my project:

- Region Proposal Network
- Non-maxima suppression (To filter out a certain number of potential regions
- Final Classifier (to classify some interested region - RoI)
